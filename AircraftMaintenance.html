                        If you thought flying was all about pilots, guess again.<br><br>
                        No aircraft anywhere leaves the ground without being checked by an engineer. Being an aircraft maintenance engineer means working on the most exciting and advanced technology in the world. So if an exciting and interesting career working as part of a dynamic team, on some of the newest and most powerful machines on the planet is for you, then there is no better job for you than this. Aircraft engineers are always in demand by airlines and aviation companies all over the world.<br><br>
                        This job can take you all over Australia, to Asia, the Middle East and Europe. You can earn great pay, receive fabulous travel benefits for you and your family and all this start with us here at MUSA Emerging Sciences Academy.
                    <p>MUSA Emerging Sciences Academy courses provide you with the essential training required to begin your career in Aircraft Maintenance. We also offer courses for employees already working in the industry who are looking to upskill or advance their careers.</p>
                    <p>Aircraft Maintenance Engineering is recognized by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and for the purpose of aircraft maintenance engineer licensing. EASA sets the world standard for aircraft maintenance engineering allowing trainees to pursue career in aircraft maintenance in Pakistan and around the globe.</p>
                    <h2>Difference between Aerospace engineering and an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer:</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Most of the general public thinks that aerospace engineers are the maintenance engineers which are wrong concepts developed in our society.</p>
                    <p>Aerospace engineering is the primary branch of engineering concerned with the research, design, development, construction, testing, science and technology of aircraft and spacecraft. It is divided into two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Aeronautics deals with aircraft that operate in earth atmosphere, and astronautics deals with spacecraft that operates outside the earth’s atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Aeronautical engineering was the original term for the field. As flight technology advanced to include craft operating in outer space, the broader term “aerospace engineering” has largely replaced it in common usage. Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often referred to colloquially as “rocket science”, such as in popular culture.</p>
                    <p>An aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) is a licensed person who carries out and certifies aircraft maintenance. This same title is used in a number of different countries, including Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, India, and New Zeeland. A licensed aircraft maintenance engineer (L – AME) is an AME with an inspection authorization.</p>
                    <h2>License categories</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Aircrft maintenance license include the following categories:</p>
