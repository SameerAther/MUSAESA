					<hr style="width:60%">
                    <p>BTEC HNDs are international qualifications aimed at students aged 18 and above. They provide a programme of work-related, specialist learning that reflects the professional skills demanded by employers.</p>
                    <h2>What will you learn?</h2>
					<hr style="width:60%">
                    <p>Each BTEC HND qualification is based on modern industry practice. Learning is broken down into units, each helping you gain a specific set of in-depth skills and knowledge. The overall qualification structure is designed to provide you with all the essential competencies needed for the workplace, through a choice of units tailored to your needs.</p>
                    <h2>How long does a BTEC HND take?</h2>
					<hr style="width:60%">
                    <p>Because of the in-depth nature of BTEC HND learning, the qualification is typically studied over two academic years as a full-time course. Many BTEC HND providers also help their learners connect with industry through work experience, helping them to see first-hand how the skills they are gaining apply in the workplace.</p>
                    <h2>What can you do with your BTEC HND?</h2>

                    <h2>Progress to employment:</h2>
					<hr style="width:52%">
                    <p>Because of the industry-relevant skills and knowledge BTEC HNDs are based on, many employers, including Shell, BAE Systems, PWC and Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, actively recruit applicants with these qualifications. Many institutions that deliver BTEC HNDs have close links with local employers and often provide their own progression pathways into employment with these companies and organizations. In addition, over 70 professional bodies recognize BTEC HNDs for membership. In an increasingly competitive global jobs marketplace, a BTEC HND will help you stand out from the crowd.</p>
                    <h2>Progress to a degree:</h2>
					<hr style="width:52%">
                    <p>BTEC HNDs are highly valued by universities all over the world and are widely recognized as equivalent to the first two years of a degree course, which allows you to go straight into the final year of many degree courses – known as a top-up degree. Studying a BTEC HND is a great way to experience a blend of local and overseas study on your route to a degree. Some BTEC HND providers work directly with universities to give their learners the chance to get their top-up degree in the same place they studied their HND. To find out where your BTEC HND can take you, visit the Degree Course Finder, where you can search from more than 1,500 degree courses at nearly 300 universities worldwide.</p>
